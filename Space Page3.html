		Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system. Its size is so big that every single planet could fit inside of Jupiter. Similarly to the sun it is composed of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter has no real firm surface since it is composed of gases. If you tried to stand on its surface you would sink and be crushed due to the pressure. The gravity on this planet is 2.5 times the gravity of Earth. On Jupiter there are many intense storms. The biggest being the Giant Red Spot storm. This storm is 300 years old and is continually spreading extreme winds that at times can exceed 400 miles per hour. This storm is approximately the size of Earth. Something that you might not know about Jupiter is that it has rings. These rings are quite faint and can’t even be seen with the assistance of telescopes.

		Saturn is the second largest planet in the solar system and is the sixth planet away from the sun. It was first gazed upon in 1610 by the well known Italian astronomer Galileo. Like the fellow gas giants, Saturn is a massive gaseous planet mostly composed of hydrogen and helium. It is not a very dense planet. If Saturn were to be submerged in a tub of water it would float because of its mainly gas composition. Saturn has magnificent rings that are never forgotten. While it is not the only planet with rings, without a doubt however Saturn definitely has the most spectacular rings. These rings are made up of pieces of comets, asteroids, and broken pieces of moons that have been torn apart by Saturn’s powerful gravity. One random fact that people don’t know is that on Saturn’s North Pole the clouds there are formed in a hexagonal pattern.

		Uranus is the coldest planet in our solar system and is located as the seventh planet from the Sun. It was the first planet to be discovered during the modern age. It was discovered in 1781 by William Herschel during the early age of use of telescopes. While it is classified as a gas giant, it is so cold there that it is referred to as an ice giant. It is mainly composed of water, methane, and ammonia that is in the form of ice. Above the icy surface of Uranus is the atmosphere. Its atmosphere is mostly made up of hydrogen, helium, and methane molecules. Due to the intense pressure on Uranus carbon atoms were squeezed together forming graphite and then even further compressed into solid diamonds. Here on Earth diamonds are expensive and costly but apparently not on planets like Uranus.

        Neptune, the farthest planet from the sun, is located in the furthermost regions of our solar system. It was discovered in 1846 by three respected astronomers. Neptune was the first planet to be discovered using mathematics. It is a large planet which has a volume 50 times larger than that of Earth. Neptune is a windy place with wind speeds of 1,200 mph. These wind speeds are faster than sound here on Earth. Neptune actually has the strongest winds in the Solar System. In 1989 it was confirmed that Neptune has rings. These rings are made up of clumps of dust and debris. Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft that has visited Neptune. This lack of exploration means that we still have a lot to learn about this distant icy world.
