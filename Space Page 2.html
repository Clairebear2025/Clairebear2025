		The Sun, is the beautiful star that sits in the center of our solar system. It is a star consisting of hot plasma interwoven with a magnetic field. Chemically, however, it is composed of gases, primarily hydrogen and helium. Over 4.6 billion years old, this yellow dwarf star is vital for all of our lives. For it is the sun that supplies heat as well as light to our solar system. This light is composed of the continuous collisions of hydrogen atoms. When enough hydrogen atoms collide, a single helium atom emerges. These collisions convert matter into energy. All this converted energy heats the core of our star which provokes the mass production of radiation. These packets of radiation, what we know as photons, travel outward from the core of the sun and advance in the vastness of space. These photons eventually reach our planet, Earth. Here it supplies our planet with the gift of life, the weather, and the warmth which we feel on a day filled with sunshine. 

    The Sun has an extraordinary mass 333,000 times the mass of Earth. This celestial object’s mass accounts for basically the entire mass of our solar systems. To be specific 99.8 percent of our solar system’s mass. That’s a lot! Our sun is quite big, however, when comparing it to other stars it seems merely average. There are stars out in the cosmos that are 700 even 100 times larger! However, if our sun was any larger our planet Earth wouldn’t even be habitable!

		Mercury is the smallest planet within our solar system. It resides as the closest planet to the sun. As a result of its proximity to the sun, Mercury’s surface temperature at times can reach a blazing 840 degrees Fahrenheit. However, without a substantial atmosphere, Mercury is unable to permanently entrap heat. When furthermost from the sun, temperatures can rapidly descend to degrees from -200 to -290 degrees Fahrenheit. Mercury’s atmosphere is nonexistent which can creates many problems. Its thin atmosphere is not great at deflecting the impacts of meteorites and asteroids. Subsequently, not having much of an atmosphere to slow down or deteriorate meteorites, Mercury’s surface is largely consumed by craters. About 4 billion years ago, an asteroid 60 miles wide collided with Mercury which created its biggest crater ( Caloris Basin ) which roughly measures 960 miles wide. This crater is so big, it could even hold the entire state of Texas!

		Venus is the second planet away from the sun. It is a very distant and different world than our own. It has a similar mass and size that resembles Earth. The most prominent difference however is the climate. Venus is a hot dry place with absolutely no trace of water.   Its surface is incredibly hot and has an average surface temperature of 863 degrees Fahrenheit.  It is hypothesized that Venus billions of years ago greatly resembled Earth. Venus is thought to have been a planet that once possessed oceans. These theoretical oceans are no longer here today because of the high temperatures which most likely boiled them off. Traveling above the surface is the atmosphere of Venus. Its sky is filled with opaque sulphuric acid clouds that conceal its surface. Venus’s atmosphere is roughly 90 times more massive than Earth and is composed of carbon dioxide and nitrogen. As a result of this thick atmosphere, all the heat radiated from the sun is trapped within this atmosphere and heats Venus. One last fact about this planet is that it is one of the only planets in our solar system to be named after a female figure. Venus is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.

		Earth is the place that we all call home. Taking 365 days to travel around the Sun our Earth is the only place humanity has ever known. Earth has one satellite, the moon. This familiar sight in the sky is a desolated cratered-filled object. It is believed that the moon was created as the byproduct of a cosmic collision between Earth and another planet-sized object. This catastrophic collision sent large chunks of the planets and debris into space, which later was coalesced to form the moon. Earth is the largest terrestrial planet and most notably the only known planet to support life. Life on this planet for a billion years has greatly evolved. Throughout the history of mankind knowledge about our home planet has been greatly sought after. Not until the times of  Copernicus in the sixteenth century did we accept the fact that Earth is not the center of our universe or that the Earth is spherical rather than flat. Our perception and understanding has advanced through the application of science and has allowed us to truly acknowledge the beauty in our ordinary but unique place in the universe.

		Mars is a fascinating planet that has sparked many people’s interest since ancient times. Located as the fourth planet always from the sun, Mars has an average surface temperature of -80 degrees Fahrenheit. Its surface is rocky and filled with volcanic activity. Olympus Mons is the largest volcano in our solar system and is on Mars.  Mars is also the home to two permanent ice caps. These ice caps are composed of ice formed by carbon dioxide. The atmosphere of Mars is thin and mainly composed of carbon dioxide which would not support life. Its beautiful skies are a pink hue and are some of the most scenic in the solar system. Many people are drawn to Mars with much curiosity about the red hue it projects. Many studies are being held on Mars and hopefully will expand our understanding of this mysterious planet.
